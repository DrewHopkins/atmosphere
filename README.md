# Atmosphere, Airspeed, & Propulsion

## Atmosphere properties
We will show the properties of earth's atmosphere through plots and beable to calculate the air properties at certain altitiudes and generate a code that allows us to find the altitude for a given density

## Airspeed
Given the calibrated airspeed and the altitude of a airplane, we will be able to decipher the true airspeed and mach number at the altitude

## Propulsion
Given the altitude and Mach number of an airplane we will be able to determine the thrust and thrust-specific fuel consumption 
of a low bypass turbofan engine
